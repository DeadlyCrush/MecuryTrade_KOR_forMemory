# MecuryTrade_KOR_forMemory

## MercuryTrade KOR Version.
I managed MercuryTrade KOR and Improving DeadlyTrade 0.1.0.1 over and over. And I prepared overhaul version after Exslim said officially that he will does not maintain.

## MercuryTrade KOR Version is out-date.
Thank you for your effort as a frontier 'Exslims'.

## About DeadlyTrade
It started from inspired Mercurytrade when I made and share Korean version of Mecurytrade. Addon name 'DeadlyTrade' also inspired by 'MercuryTrade' including my respect to great exslims mercury trade ("Deadly"Crush + Mercury"Trade"). But All of my add-ons including this, DeadlyTrade, started empty handed, completely on my own and It comply with ggg's TOS.  I released DeadlyTrade beta version After the Mid-June, 2019 official launch of Kakao client. I forked and made Mercury Trade KOR version with Korean UI and every functions for Korean user and shared until great Exslims no longer maintain officially.
